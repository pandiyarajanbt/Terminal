# Terminal Repository

Welcome to the **Terminal Repository** – a backend-only project built with the goal of providing a robust, scalable system using modern Python technologies and best practices.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Django
- **Language**: Python
- **API**: REST API
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**: Used for efficient backend logic
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Other Tools**: CELL (as part of the system architecture)

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository currently contains **only the backend**. All logic, APIs, and services are implemented using Django and Python. There is **no frontend** at the moment.

If you're a developer or learner interested in building a frontend for this project, feel free to fork or clone the repository — the code is open and accessible to all.

## 🌍 Purpose

This repository is shared **strictly for educational purposes only**.

- You are free to read, learn, and build on top of this code.
- Not intended for commercial use.
- Ideal for students, backend learners, or contributors who want to understand scalable backend architectures.

## 🤝 Contributions Welcome!

If you're a developer who:

- Wants to create a frontend for this backend,
- Loves working with Django and REST APIs,
- Believes in building scalable systems,
- Enjoys solving real-world problems using Python and DSA,

then we invite you to **join us**!

Let's work together to enhance and build scalable, real-world projects.
